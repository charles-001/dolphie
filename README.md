## Usage

```
positional arguments:
  uri                   Use a URI string for credentials (mysql/proxysql) - format: mysql://user:password@host:port (port is optional with default 3306, or 6032 for ProxySQL)

options:
  --help                show this help message and exit
  --tab-setup           Start Dolphie by showing the Tab Setup modal instead of automatically connecting with the specified options
  -C , --cred-profile   Credential profile to use. See below for more information

  -P , --port           Port (socket has precedence)
  -S , --socket         Socket file
  -c , --config-file    Dolphie's config file to use. Options are read from these files in the given order: ['/etc/dolphie.cnf', '/etc/dolphie/dolphie.cnf', '~/.dolphie.cnf']
  -m , --mycnf-file     MySQL config file path to use. This should use [client] section [default: ~/.my.cnf]
  -l , --login-path     Specify login path to use with mysql_config_editor's file ~/.mylogin.cnf for encrypted login credentials [default: client]
  -r , --refresh-interval
                        How much time to wait in seconds between each refresh [default: 1]
  --host-cache-file     Resolve IPs to hostnames when your DNS is unable to. Each IP/hostname pair should be on its own line using format ip=hostname [default: ~/dolphie_host_cache]
  --tab-setup-file      Specify location of file that stores the available hosts to use in Tab Setup modal [default: ~/dolphie_hosts]
  --heartbeat-table     (MySQL only) If your hosts use pt-heartbeat, specify table in format db.table to use the timestamp it has for replication lag instead of Seconds_Behind_Master from SHOW REPLICA STATUS
  --ssl-mode            Desired security state of the connection to the host. Supports: REQUIRED/VERIFY_CA/VERIFY_IDENTITY [default: OFF]
  --ssl-ca              Path to the file that contains a CA (certificate authority)

  -H , --hostgroup      This is used for creating tabs and connecting to them for hosts you specify in Dolphie's config file under a hostgroup section. As an example, you'll have a section called [cluster1] then below it you will list each host on a new line in the format key=host (keys have no meaning). Hosts support optional port (default is whatever port parameter is) in the format host:port. You can also name the tabs by suffixing ~tab_name to the host (i.e. 1=host~tab_name)
  -R, --record          Enables recording of Dolphie's data to a replay file. Note: This can use significant disk space. Monitor accordingly!
  -D, --daemon          Starts Dolphie in daemon mode. This will not show the TUI and is designed be put into the background with whatever solution you decide to use. Automatically enables --record. This mode is solely used for recording data to a replay file
  --daemon-log-file     Full path of the log file for daemon mode
  --replay-file         Specify the full path of the replay file to load and enable replay mode
  --replay-dir          Directory to store replay data files
  --replay-retention-hours
                        Number of hours to keep replay data. Data will be purged every hour [default: 48]
  --exclude-notify-vars
                        Dolphie will let you know when a global variable has been changed. If you have variables that change frequently and you don't want to see them, you can specify which ones with this option separated by a comma (i.e. --exclude-notify-vars=variable1,variable2)
  --show-trxs-only      (MySQL only) Start with only showing threads that have an active transaction
  --additional-columns  Start with additional columns in Processlist panel
  --debug-options       Display options that are set and what they're set by (command-line, dolphie config, etc) then exit. WARNING: This will show passwords and other sensitive information in plain text
  -V, --version         Display version and exit

Order of precedence for methods that pass options to Dolphie:
	1. Command-line
	2. Credential profile (set by --cred-profile)
	3. Environment variables
	4. Dolphie's config (set by --config-file)
	5. ~/.mylogin.cnf (mysql_config_editor)
	6. ~/.my.cnf (set by --mycnf-file)

Credential profiles can be defined in Dolphie's config file as a way to store credentials for easy access.
A profile can be created by adding a section in the config file with the format: [credential_profile_<name>]
When using a credential profile, do not include the prefix 'credential_profile' (i.e. -C production)
The following options are supported in credential profiles:
	user
	password
	socket
	ssl_mode REQUIRED/VERIFY_CA/VERIFY_IDENTITY
	ssl_ca

```

## Supported ProxySQL versions

- ProxySQL 2.6+ (could work on previous versions but not tested)

Note: Use `admin` user instead of `stats` user so you can use all features

## Supported MariaDB versions

- MariaDB 5.5/10.0/11.0+
- RDS MariaDB

## Supported MySQL versions

- MySQL/Percona Server 5.6/5.7/8.x/9.x
- RDS MySQL & Aurora/Azure

## MySQL Grants required

#### Least privilege

1. PROCESS (only if you switch to using processlist via `P` command)
2. SELECT to `performance_schema` + `pt-heartbeat table` (if used)
3. REPLICATION CLIENT/REPLICATION SLAVE

#### Recommended

1. PROCESS (only if you switch to using processlist via `P` command)
2. Global SELECT access (good for explaining queries, listing all databases, etc)
3. REPLICATION CLIENT/REPLICATION SLAVE
4. SUPER (required if you want to kill queries)

## Record & Replay

Have you ever wished you could view the process list and various other related statistics from a specific moment in time? Perhaps during a database stall that led to an incident, and your monitoring tools failed to identify the root cause? Well, you're in luck! Dolphie has a Replay system that lets you do just that.

Starting with version **6.0.0**, you can instruct Dolphie to record its data (via `--record`) into a local SQLite database file that's compressed with ZSTD. When you're ready to replay this data, simply pass the `--replay-file` option, and you can interact with it as if you were watching it live! Within the Replay interface, you can navigate with the controls: back, forward, play/pause, or seek to a specific datetime. While some features are disabled during replay, the essential functionalities remain intact. For a complete list of available commands, press `?` to access the help menu.

Note that this feature can incur a significant amount of disk space depending on how busy your server is and what you set `--replay-retention-hours` + `--refresh-interval`. Adjust these values to suit your needs and monitor the disk space usage accordingly.

## Daemon Mode

Also introduced in version **6.0.0** is the ability to run Dolphie in daemon mode (via `--daemon` option). It's designed to run in the background continuously recording data for future replay. Itâ€™s more resource-efficient than running Dolphie live, transforming it into a passive, always-on monitoring service. It eliminates Textual's TUI and creates a log file for messages while also displaying them in the console.

You have flexibility in how you run Dolphie in the background; personally, I prefer using `systemctl`, but alternatives like `nohup` or `tmux` can be viable options.

Here's some examples of log messages you might see:

```
[INFO] Starting Dolphie v6.0.0 in daemon mode with a refresh interval of 1s
[INFO] Log file: /var/log/dolphie/dolphie.log
[INFO] Connected to MySQL with Process ID 324
[INFO] Replay SQLite file: /var/lib/dolphie/replays/localhost/daemon.db (24 hours retention)
[INFO] Connected to SQLite
[INFO] Replay database metadata - Host: localhost, Port: 3306, Source: MySQL (Percona Server), Dolphie: 6.3.0
[INFO] ZSTD compression dictionary trained with 10 samples (size: 52.56KB)
[WARNING] Read-only mode changed: R/W -> RO
[INFO] Global variable innodb_io_capacity changed: 1000 -> 2000
```

## Credential Profiles

Credential profiles can be defined in Dolphie's config file as a way to store credentials for easy access. A profile can be created by adding a section in the config file with the format: `[credential_profile_<name>]`
The following options are supported in credential profiles:

- user
- password
- socket
- ssl_mode REQUIRED/VERIFY_CA/VERIFY_IDENTITY
- ssl_ca
- ssl_cert
- ssl_key
- mycnf_file
- login_path

Example:

```ini
[credential_profile_dev]
user = dev_user
password = dev_password

[credential_profile_prod]
mycnf_file = /secure/path/to/prod.cnf
```

To use a credential profile, you can specify it with `-C`/`--cred-profile` option without using the prefix `credential_profile` (i.e. `-C prod`) when starting Dolphie. Hostgroups can also use credential profiles (see below)

## Hostgroups

Hostgroups are a way to easily connect to multiple hosts at once. To set this up, you will create a section in Dolphie's config file with the name you want the hostgroup to be and list each host on a new line in the format `key=<json>` (keys have no meaning). Hosts support optional port (default is whatever `port` parameter is) in the format `host:port`. Once ready, you will use the parameter `hostgroup` or `Host Setup` modal to see it in action!

Note: Colors can be used in the tab name by using the format `[color]text[/color]` (i.e. `[red]production[/red]`). You can also use emojis supported by Rich (can see them by running `python -m rich.emoji`) by using the format `:emoji:` (i.e. `:ghost:`). Rich supports the normal emoji shortcodes.

Example:

```ini
[cluster1]
1={"host": "host1", "tab_title": "[yellow]host1[/yellow] :ghost:", "credential_profile": "dev"}
2={"host": "host2", "tab_title": "[blue]host2[/blue] :ghost:", "credential_profile": "dev"}
3={"host": "host3:3307", "tab_title": "[red]production[/red]", "credential_profile": "prod"}
4={"host": "host4"}
```
